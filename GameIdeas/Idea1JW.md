Reveal who is under the armor.
You (a Samurai) forgot who you were. Remove armour to find out who you were.
Your normal person clothes are underneath. It's more metaphorical.

## Story Reveal Mechanic

Helmet is last.

Levels where at the end there is a incomplete suit of armour that you give a piece to.
maybe different themes that are to do with the story the armour reveals
