# Concept

## Story

Reveal who is under the armor. You (a Samurai) forgot who you were. Remove armour to find out who you were. Your normal person clothes are underneath. It's more metaphorical.
Story Reveal Mechanic

Remove your armour and complete sets of other samurai's armour to reveal what that samurai did for you before you were a samurai. The scenes will be pivotal parts of your life, but still mysterious. Helmet is last.

## Gameplay Component(s)
Individually controlled limbs to hit or dodge things that are telegraphed
Armor on limb affects how game is played. (Not sure how, dodge if you have no armour, hit if you do?)

Maybe you end up turning into that video where a guy just walks around and reks someone whos trying to karate them. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqi9_9jeKDAxU37LsIHUE_AkMQtwJ6BAgOEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDVs--uHf4sE&usg=AOvVaw1U_tnaYTlveEiPyZ_hSO6x&opi=89978449
Levels

At the end of levels there is a incomplete suit of armour that you give a piece to. Maybe levels have different themes that are to do with the story the armour reveals.



# Considerations

## Pacing 
JW I think it will be good to have fast and slow paced sections to break it up. I was thinking cutscenes and the gameplay, but idk if that will be enough slow paced stuff?
